> Starting February 28th, 2019, we will be deprecating MATRIX OS (MOS). Additionally, we have created a new library called MATRIX Lite which allows you to easily program your MATRIX Device with just one line of code. To find out more information about the deprecation of MOS and to learn more about our new library, MATRIX Lite, checkout our community post [here.](https://community.matrix.one/t/mos-being-deprecated-announcing-new-library-matrix-lite/2240)

IMPORTANT: No endpoints work until `authenticate` or `makeUrls` is called. This generates urls for the endpoints.

## Overview

**Matrix Node SDK ** helps the MatrixOS and Matrix CLI connect with the API and the MXSS.
